# Dimensionality Reduction
Whenever we start a data analysis problem, one of the most initial steps that we undergo is some sort of exploratory data analysis of raw data at hand. Exploring your data is a crucial step as until you have basic understanding of your data viz structure of it, it's somewhat difficult to know whether the data you've is suitable for the task we gotta perform or is something from which we can draw any insights. In real world problems, raw data consists of many features. On one hand it's good to have multiple features as it allows our models to generalize well, but on the other it's bad as we can only work things out for visualizations upto 3 dimensions. So how can we go on exploring our data? The answer to this problem is Dimensionality Reduction. Dimensionality Reduction helps us out by providing a simpler and more compact representations of our original raw data to either aid our understanding or to provide useful input for the incoming stages of analysis. Let's get started!
