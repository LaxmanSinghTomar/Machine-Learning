# Machine Learning Tutorials

This is a continuously updated repository that documents tutorials on Machine Learning. 

**Goal:** Introduce Machine Learning contents in Jupyter Notebooks. The content aims to strike a good balance between underlying math, educational implementation from scratch using Pythonâ€™s scientific stack including Numpy, Numba, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc. and open-source library usage such as Scikit-learn, Pyspark, Gensim, Keras, Pytorch, Tensorflow, etc.

## Contents

1. Dimensionality Reduction [[Notebook](https://github.com/LaxmanSinghTomar/Machine-Learning/tree/master/Tutorials/Dimensionality%20Reduction)]

2. Regularization [[Notebook](https://github.com/LaxmanSinghTomar/Machine-Learning/tree/master/Tutorials/Regularization)]
