# Machine-Learning
This is a repository dedicated to comprehensive guide to Machine Learning.

## Overview :zap:
One of the major difference between Humans & Machines is Humans learn from past experiences whereas Machines need to be told what to do which is known as Programming. You write a set of Instructions which they follow. Now the Question arises, can we get Machines learn from experiences too? The answer is yes! That's what Machine Learning is all about. The idea of getting Machines learn without being explicitly programmed is known as Machine Learning. In case of Machines, experiences are referred as Data.
In 1998 Tom Mitchell quoted:
> A computer program is said to learn from experience **E** with respect to some task **T** and some performance measure **P**, if it's performance on **T** as measured by **P**, improves with experience **E**.

Let's understand it in Layman Terms. Suppose you wish to throw the Basketball in the basket. If you're a novice like me, you might use too much force on first attempt and you get failed :disappointed:. In second attempt your force was fine enough but it didn't get in there; maybe your throwing angle needs to be changed a little bit. What's happening here, you're learning what needs to be done in order to get your ball in basket. And eventually you'd see after many attempts you succeeded. Here:

**T**: To put the Basketball in basket
**E**: Learning several things viz. force to be applied, throwing angle
**P**: Number of Successful attempts with respect to Total Attempts

Here's another simple example. Suppose you have a program which watches which email you don't mark as spam and which one you do. Based on that terms, it learns how to better filter spam emails. What's the task T here?

**T**: Classifying emails as spam or not spam
**E**: Watching you label emails sas spam or not spam
**P**: Number of emails correctly classified as spam or not spam
Easy isn't it?

# Applications Of Machine Learning
There are wide variety of uses of Machine Learning. Some of them are listed below:
- **Health Care** : Drug Discovery/Manufacturing, Medication, Diagnosis of Diseases
- **Product Recommendations** : Recommending Products & Servies based on what you prefer
- **Face & Object Detection** : Identify faces and objects in images and videos
- **Predictions** : Predictions about weather, finance etc.
and many many more...

# Need of Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a part of what we call Artificial Intelligence or AI. There are many kinds of complex problems which are beyond Human mind's capability. A realization came in according to which, we can only perform such tasks if they are handed over to Machines. They can learn by themselves and can provide us meaningful results. As there is large amount of Data out there and our brains cannot find patterns in each one of them quickly, Machine Learning came into existence by providing results in less time. But earlier, due to Computers not having better hardware for such computations it was not as effective; until recently since 2006 it saw a major change. Now we have better hardware to support us through. And that's where Machine Learning pulled off a revolution.
